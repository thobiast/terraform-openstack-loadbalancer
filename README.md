Terraform module to create Load Balancer on OpenStack.

## Terraform versions

It requires Terraform version 0.13 or later.

For Terraform v0.11 and v0.12 use version v0.1.\* of this module.

## Usage example

Create a http load balancer:

```hcl
### Load balancer
module "openstack-lb" {
  source            = "git::https://github.com/thobiast/terraform-openstack-loadbalancer.git"
  name              = "test-http"
  lb_description    = "Test load balancer using terraform module"
  lb_vip_subnet_id  = var.public_subnet_id
  member_address    = openstack_compute_instance_v2.myinstances[*].access_ip_v4
  member_subnet_id  = var.private_subnet_id
}
```

Create a https balance with certificate on backend servers:

```hcl
### Load balancer
module "openstack-lb" {
  source            = "git::https://github.com/thobiast/terraform-openstack-loadbalancer.git"
  name              = "test-https-backend"
  lb_description    = "Test load balancer using terraform module"
  lb_vip_subnet_id  = var.public_subnet_id

  listener_protocol      = "HTTPS"
  listener_protocol_port = "443"

  lb_pool_protocol  = "HTTPS"
  member_port       = "443"
  member_address    = openstack_compute_instance_v2.myinstances[*].access_ip_v4
  member_subnet_id  = var.private_subnet_id
}
```

Create a https balance with certificate stored on the load balancer:

```hcl
### Load balancer
module "openstack-lb" {
  source            = "git::https://github.com/thobiast/terraform-openstack-loadbalancer.git"
  name              = "test-https-balance"
  lb_description    = "Test load balancer using terraform module"
  lb_vip_subnet_id  = var.public_subnet_id

  listener_protocol      = "TERMINATED_HTTPS"
  listener_protocol_port = "443"
  certificate            = "my_certificate_file.crt"
  private_key            = "my_private_key_file.key"

  lb_pool_protocol  = "HTTP"
  member_port       = "80"
  member_address    = openstack_compute_instance_v2.myinstances[*].access_ip_v4
  member_subnet_id  = var.private_subnet_id
}
```
